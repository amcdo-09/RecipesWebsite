            <li>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a British breed of toy dog of spaniel type. Four colours are recognised: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby; the coat is smooth and silky.[2] The lifespan is usually between eight and twelve years.</li>
            <li>The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late seventeenth century, when it was inter-bred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, it shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. </li>
            <li>Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration â€“ a dog resembling Charles II's spaniel of the English Civil War period, when supporters of the king were known as Cavaliers.</li>
