# RecipesWebsite
This is my first website based on what I've learned from the The Odin Project. It is HTML website.
In this website I will display basic HTML functions such as the HTML Boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, images and links. 
UPDATE** Some basic CSS Styles have been applied also including ID and class selectors, colors, background colors and image resizing!
Enjoy! :))
